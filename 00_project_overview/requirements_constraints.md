# Requirements and Constraints

## 1. Competition Constraints
- Maximum battery energy: ≤ 100 Wh
- Maximum propulsion current: ≤ 100 A
- Takeoff distance requirement: ≤ 20 ft

These constraints are treated as non-negotiable.

## 2. Aircraft Configuration Constraints
- Landing gear configuration: Taildragger
- Propeller hub height: 10 inches above ground
- Landing gear geometry fixed by CAD design

## 3. Design Assumptions
- Takeoff rotation angle: ≈ 12°
- Landing gear squat: ≈ 0.4 inches
- Propeller ground clearance margin: ≈ 1.5 inches

## 4. Fixed vs Variable Parameters

### Fixed
- Competition rules (100 Wh, 100 A, TOFL)
- Landing gear configuration and hub height

### Variable
- Propeller diameter within geometric limits
- Motor Kv and size
- Battery architecture (5S vs 6S)
- Electrical protection strategy
