# Manufacturing and Assembly

## Purpose
This directory documents the **manufacturing, wiring, and assembly activities**
for the DBF aircraft **after physical implementation begins**.

At the current project stage, this directory serves as a placeholder to
define scope and timing for manufacturing documentation.

---

## When Content Will Be Added
Documents will be added to this directory **only after**:
- Components are procured
- Physical wiring and assembly begin
- Actual routing, fastening, and integration decisions are made

This avoids speculative or assumption-based manufacturing documentation.

---

## Expected Contents
Once implementation begins, this directory will include:
- Assembly procedures and build sequence
- Electrical wiring harness build steps
- Connector crimping and strain relief methods
- Quality assurance and inspection checklists
- Photographic records of assembly and integration

---

## Relation to Other Directories
- Design intent and constraints are defined in `00_project_overview/` and `04_electrical_system/`
- Bench and flight testing procedures are defined in `06_test_and_validation/`

---

## Status
No manufacturing or assembly activities have started at this time.

This directory will be populated as the project transitions from
design to implementation.
